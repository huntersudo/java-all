# Chapter 11: Serialization

## Item 74: Implement `Serializable` judiciously

The ease of implementing `Serializable` is specious. Unless a class is to be thrown away after a short period of use, implementing `Serializable` is a serious commitment that should be made with care. Extra caution is warranted if a class is designed for inheritance. For such classes, an intermediate design point between implementing `Serializable` and prohibiting it in subclasses is to provide an accessible parameterless constructor. This design point permits, but does not require, subclasses to implement `Serializable`.

## Item 75: Consider using a custom serialized form

When you have decided that a class should be serializable ([Item 74](chapter-11.md#item-74-implement-serializable-judiciously)), think hard about what the serialized form should be. Use the default serialized form only if it is a reasonable description of the logical state of the object; otherwise design a custom serialized form that aptly describes the object. You should allocate as much time to designing the serialized form of a class as you allocate to designing its exported methods ([Item 40](chapter-7.md#item-40-design-method-signatures-carefully)). Just as you cannot eliminate exported methods from future versions, you cannot eliminate fields from the serialized form; they must be preserved forever to ensure serialization compatibility. Choosing the wrong serialized form can have a permanent, negative impact on the complexity and performance of a class.

## Item 76: Write readObject methods defensively

Anytime you write a readObject method, adopt the mind-set that you are writing a public constructor that must produce a valid instance regard- less of what byte stream it is given. Do not assume that the byte stream represents an actual serialized instance. While the examples in this item concern a class that uses the default serialized form, all of the issues that were raised apply equally to classes with custom serialized forms.

## Item 77: For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve

You should use enum types to enforce instance control invariants wherever possible. If this is not possible and you need a class to be both serializable and instance-controlled, you must provide a `readResolve` method and ensure that all of the classâ€™s instance fields are either primitive or transient.

## Item 78: Consider serialization proxies instead of serialized instances

Consider the serialization proxy pattern whenever you find yourself having to write a `readObject` or `writeObject` method on a class that is not extendable by its clients. This pattern is perhaps the easiest way to robustly serialize objects with nontrivial invariants.
